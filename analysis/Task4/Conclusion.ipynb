    "From my exploratory data analysis I discovered that I need to log transform the data and remove lowly expressed genes before moving onto data analysis in Task 5. This was determined by visualizing the data using a histogram which was skewed right for all three conditions - stationary phase, growth phase, and ampicillin treatment. Additional issues were found while visualizing using a pair plot likely for the same reasons. The correlation was excellent although with all values being close to one. Lastly, I found there were 4359 expression values with the highest expression levels found in the ampicillin treatment and lowest in the stationary phase.   "
